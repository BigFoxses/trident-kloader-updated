# Trident + Kloader Updated 

#### IMPORTANT NOTICE! The iPhones 5,1 5,2 5,3 and the iPads 3,1 3,2 3,3 experience issues on 9.3.x. We are aware of the problem. If you experience issues on said devices please DONT open another issue thread! Instead comment on an already existing one, thanks!

The original version by torachiyo didn't work for some firmwares/ devices, so here it is updated.  
* Original Verion can be found here: Trident + Kloader for iPhone 4S http://bbs.feng.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=11005851&extra=page%3D1  

Trident+kloader is a utility that makes use of the Trident exploit chain.  
* Original Trident exploit: https://github.com/benjamin-42/Trident  

Trident + Kloader is a utility that allows people with 32-Bit devices on iOS 9.2-9.3.4 to downgrade their device, without the use of a fully fledged jailbreak!  
Usage description and Information can be found futher down!

    This Device is a special case, its not possible to really support the device than through trial and error, since there are NO public keys for the firmwares which makes finding the right memory offsets quite the challenge.  
    You may still request support for this device, but dont expect anythingthing from it!  
    Also Trident+Kloader is because of said problem not useful for owners of these devices, they cant utilize odysseus anyway.
   With that said, these versions are supported anyway, use at your own risk!:
  * iOS 9.2 (Castlerock 13C57)
  * iOS 9.2.1 (Dillon 13D15)
  * iOS 9.3 (Eagle 13E233)
  * iOS 9.3 (Eagle 13E237)
  * iOS 9.3.1 (Eagle 13E238)
  * iOS 9.3.2 (Frisco 13F69)
  * iOS 9.3.3 (Genoa 13G34)
  * iOS 9.3.4 (Genoa 13G35)

 
### The following devices can be downgraded to 6.1.3 with Trident+Kloader:
(Because the OTA update for iOS 6.1.3 is still signed for devices sold with iOS 5.0)

* iPhone 4S [iPhone4,1 (N94AP)]
* iPad 2 WiFi [iPad2,1 (K93AP)]
* iPad 2 GSM [iPad2,2 (K94AP)]
* iPad 2 CDMA [iPad2,3 (K95AP)]

I successfully downgraded my iPad2,1 from 9.3.3 to 6.1.3 using those updated sources, the libimobiledevice MinGW Build (https://mega.nz/#!tt9zTB6D!S_uzQWfogZIuKzLACrFY56Rb_CTC0Oj0X1re6myU3T0) and odysseusOTA (http://dayt0n.github.io/odysseus/odysseus-0.999.zip) on Windows 10.


#### A compiled ipa made by DjSn0wfall is in the build directory, use Cydia Impactor to install it. 

Wait a few seconds after pressing the start button.

##### Mini guide for iPad 2,1 (Wifi only)

On my iPad2 (Wifi only), I saw a vertical green line on the right of the screen.

After I put my iPad 2 (Wifi only) in sleep mode with libimobiledevice
```Bash
idevicediagnostics sleep
```

and when the screen was black I used odysseusOTA with the correct 6.1.3 IPSW for my iPad2 (Wifi only)

```Bash
idevicerestore -e iPad2,1_6.1.3_10B329_Restore.ipsw
```
##### Important note about the mini guide

** iPhone 4S and iPad 2 (Wifi + 3G) users should follow another guide because this one doesn't downgrade the baseband, so if you don't downgrade the baseband too, your phone or the cellular connection of your iPad 2 will not work.
